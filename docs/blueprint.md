## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#7DD3FC) for a fresh, modern look. Derived from concepts of cleanliness, simplicity, and 'starter' ideas, suggestive of clear skies and new beginnings. This hue conveys a sense of calm and reliability without being overly corporate.
- Background color: Light gray (#F3F4F6), subtly desaturated and bright to complement the sky blue without overpowering it. Background keeps things airy and prevents a dark/heavy feeling that would be misaligned with a new project.
- Accent color: Teal (#5EEAD4), a vibrant analogous color, to create contrast and visual interest. Useful for highlights, call-to-action elements, or interactive components.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clean readability and modern aesthetics. Its neutrality is helpful in a boilerplate, while allowing maximal expression in later project stages.
- Simple and modern layout with a focus on content. Utilize a responsive grid system and consistent spacing.
